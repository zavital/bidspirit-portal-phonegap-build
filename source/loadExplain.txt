the idea is to create an app that will load it's resources locally, but will update itself when new version arrives.

the initial app load all it's content from the build (this probably helps the app to be approved by the build)

once the app detects that a new version appears (heartBeatService) it loads the new js and css and store them on the file system (PortalMobileUtils), then refreshes the app.

when the app loads, it detects that the version now needs to be loaded from the file system (js : at some code added to require.js, and css - on CssLoader) and load it from there.

for the texts version - there is a similar procedure, except that the texts are not updated by app version but by texts version. (I18nService)
